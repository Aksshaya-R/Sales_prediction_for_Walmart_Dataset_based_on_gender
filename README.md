# Sales_prediction_for_Walmart_Dataset_based_on_gender
The prime idea is to envisage the pattern of sales and the quantities of the products to be sold based on gender from the raw data we have. The analysis would help the business organizations to make a probabilistic decision at each important stage of marketing strategy.
To predict sales, different data mining techniques were undertaken such as:
1. Data Collection 
2. Data Pre-processing 
3. Outlier detection 
4. Correlation 
5. Classification.
The training set consists of 80% of the dataset and is used to train these models with labels.
The test set consists of 20% of the dataset and is used to test the models by predicting the labels.
The model was able to compare the performance of various machine learning classifiers and detect and predict sales with a maximum accuracy of 93% using the available dataset.
